# Bond CNI plugin

- Bonding provides a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces into a single logical &quot;bonded&quot; interface.
- According to the 802.3ad specification, Linux Bonding drivers provides various flavours of bonded interfaces depending on the mode (bonding policies), such as round robin, active aggregation
- When Bond CNI is configured as a standalone plugin, interfaces are obtained from the host network namespace. With these physical interfaces a bonded interface is created in the container network namespace.
- When used with [Multus](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni) users can bond two interfaces that have previously been passed into the container.
- A major use case for bonding in containers is network redundancy of an application in the case of network device or path failure and unavailability. For more information - refer to [network redundancy using interface bonding](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-configure-high-availability-and-network-bonding-on-linux/)
- And for more information on the bonding driver please refer to [kernel doc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt)

## Build

It is recommended that Bond CNI be built with Go 1.7.5 which has been fully tested. Later versions of Go should also be compatible but have not been validated.

- Build the source code to binary:

```
#make build-bin
```

- Copy the binary to the CNI folder for the testing:

```
# cp ./bin/bond /opt/cni/bin/
```

The binary should be placed at /opt/cni/bin on all nodes on which bonding will take place. That is all nodes to which a container with a bonded interface can be deployed.

### Network configuration reference

- name (string, required): the name of the network
- type (string, required): &quot;bond&quot;
- ifname (string, optional): name of the bond interface
- miimon (int, required): specifies the arp link monitoring frequency in milliseconds
- linksInContainer(boolean, optional): specifies if slave links are in container to start. Default is false i.e. look for interfaces on host before bonding.
- links (dictionary, required): master interface names
- ipam (dictionary, required): IPAM configuration to be used for this network

## Usage

### Standalone operation

Given the following network configuration:
```json
# cat > /etc/cni/net.d/00-flannel-bonding.conf <<EOF
{
	"name": "mynet",
	"type": "flannel",
	"delegate": {
		"type": "bond",
		"mode": "active-backup",
		"miimon": "100",
		"links": [
            {
				"name": "ens3f2"
			},
			{
				"name": "ens3f2d1"
			}
		]
	}
}
EOF
```
Note: In this example configuration above required &quot;ipam&quot; is provided by flannel plugin implicitly.

### Integration with Multus and SRIOV CNI plugin

Users can take advantage of [Multus](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni) to enable adding multiple interfaces to a K8s Pod. The [SRIOV CNI](https://github.com/intel/sriov-cni) plugin allows a SRIOV VF (Virtual Function) to be added to a container. This example shows how Bond CNI could be used in conjunction with these plugins to handle more advanced use cases e.g, high performance container networking solution for NFV environment.

- [Multus CNI- Multi Network plugin](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni)
- [SRIOV CNI](https://github.com/intel/sriov-cni)

Configuration is based on the Multus CRD Network Attachment Definition.  Please follow the configuration details in the link: [Usage with Kubernetes CRD based Network Objects](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#configuration-example)

For more information and advanced use refer to the [Network Custom Resource standard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TW3P4c8auWwYy-w_5afIPDcGNLK3LZf0m14943eVfVg/edithttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ny03h6IDVy_e_vmElOqR7UdTPAG_RNydhVE1Kx54kFQ/edit#heading=h.hylsbqoj5fxd) for more details.

#### Launching workloads in Kubernetes

Prerequisites:

- Multus configured as per the [quick start guide](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni/blob/master/doc/quickstart.md)

- SRIOV CNI and Multus CNI placed in /opt/cni/bin

1) Deploy Network Attach Definiton for SRIOV:

```
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: sriov-net1
spec:
  config: '{
  "type": "sriov",
  "name": "sriov-network"
  }
}'
```

2) Deploy Network Attach Definition for Bond CNI:

```
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: bond-net1
spec:
  config: '{
  "type": "bond",
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "bond-net1",
  "ifname": "bond0",
  "mode": "active-backup",
  "linksInContainer": true,
  "miimon": "100",
  "links": [
     {"name": "net1"},
     {"name": "net2"}
  ],
  "ipam": {
    "type": "host-local",
    "subnet": "10.56.217.0/24",
    "routes": [{
      "dst": "0.0.0.0/0"
    }],
    "gateway": "10.56.217.1"
  }

```
Note above the `"linksInContainer": true` flag. This tells the Bond CNI that the interfaces we're looking for are to be found inside the container. By default it will look for these interfaces on the host which does not work for integration with SRIOV/Multus.

3) Deploy a pod which requests two SRIOV networks and one bonded network.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-net1, sriov-net1, bond-net1
spec:  # specification of the pod's contents
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
  - name: bond-test
    image: alpine:latest
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - "-c"
      - "sleep 60m"
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

```

The order in the request annotation `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-net1, sriov-net1, bond-net1` is important as it is the same order in which networks will be added. In the above spec we add one SRIOV network, then we add another identically configured SRIOV network. Multus will give these networks the names net1 and net2 respectively.

Next the bond-net1 network is created - using interfaces net1 and net2. If bond is created before the SRIOV networks the CNI will not be able to find the interfaces in the container.

Note that the name of each interface can be set manually in the annotation according to the [CRD Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TW3P4c8auWwYy-w_5afIPDcGNLK3LZf0m14943eVfVg/edithttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ny03h6IDVy_e_vmElOqR7UdTPAG_RNydhVE1Kx54kFQ/edit#heading=h.hylsbqoj5fxd) 

After deploying the above pod spec on Kubernetes running the following command:

```kubectl exec -it test-pod -- ip a```

Will result in  output like:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth0@if150: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP 
    link/ether 62:b1:b5:c8:fb:7a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.244.1.122/24 brd 10.244.1.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP400> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 9e:23:69:42:fb:8a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.56.217.66/24 scope global bond0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
43: net1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP800> mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond0 state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 9e:23:69:42:fb:8a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.56.217.109/24 brd 10.56.217.255 scope global net1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
44: net2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP800> mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond0 state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 9e:23:69:42:fb:8a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.56.217.110/24 brd 10.56.217.255 scope global net2
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

We have three new interfaces added to our pod - net1 and net2 are SRIOV interfaces while bond0 is the bond over the two of them. Net1 and Net2 don't require IP addresses - and this can be changed in their CRD.
